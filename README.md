A simple real-time game engine for teaching object-oriented programming in Java. To create a game, extend the classes `Game`, `Level` and `Entity` for the components and rules of your game, and let `GameEngine` do the rest.

Implementations of old classics of Flappy Bird, 2048 and Space Invaders demonstrate the use of this engine.

Released under GNU GPL v3. All computer science instructors are welcome to use and adapt this framework for interesting programming projects in their Java courses.
